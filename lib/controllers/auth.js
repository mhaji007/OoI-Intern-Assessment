// ================ Auth middleware ================ //

// expressJWT middleware to check for valid token and
// also make id of user available to any role-based auth middlewares

// requireSignin looks for valid token in the request headers
// (i.e., checks for Bearer token, which is a combination of
// secret key and _id, in headers and if it is there,
// it will decode and compare the secret with our secret stored in .env
// if the two match and if token is not expired, then the token is valid)
// In other words, if a token is found, it will check the token
// against the secret and if the same secret
// is used on signing the token, then it will check
// for expiry of the token and if that checks out
// it will make the decoded token (what was used in generating the json web token)
// available on req.user (e.g., here _id is used
// in genearating the token, hence req.user._id)
exports.requireSignin = expressJwt({
  // Accessing a protected route requires secret from client
  // but we only have access to this secret when we are signed in
  // and are in possession of token

  // If token is valid, express-jwt  appends the
  // verified user id in an auth key to the request object

  // Note: alternatively user id can be obtained
  // after running requireSignin via req.user._id.
  // express-jwt will verify the JWT using JWT_SECRET from .env and the expiry date.

  // If token is valid, then the data
  // (used to create token during signin such as user._id ) is made available as req.user by default.
  // but userProperty: 'auth' ( custom configuration option ) is used here
  // So instead of req.user it makes req.auth available to access.
  // Therefore any routes that uses requireSignin, that route's controller method will have access to req.auth.
